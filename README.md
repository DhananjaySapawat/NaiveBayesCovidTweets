   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the Required Dependencies:**

   After activating the virtual environment, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the `main.py` File:**

   After installing the dependencies, you can run the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment with the following command:
